      <p>As an organization, Sursum Corda is
      committed to reflecting on, unpacking, and challenging food systems on-campus,
      locally, and globally in line with our mission of food justice. Being that Sursum
      Corda translates in Latin to "lift up your heart," we commit to the practice
      of "heart lifting" as we act compassionately in and out of service experiences. Dedicated
      primarily to off-campus service, Sursums are committed to establishing
      meaningful bonds with the greater Los Angeles community as well as with
      each other. </p>
